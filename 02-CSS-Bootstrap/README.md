# WK2hw This assignement was assigned to correspond with the activities students had for the week. We were given the responsibilty to creat our own page. We were asked to utilize HTML to create a portfolio file and  contact file about ourselves. NexBootstrat, we used CSS to style our sheet in our own personal way. My personal site displays a brief description about who I am, where I am originally from and some personal interest and activities I enjoy.
